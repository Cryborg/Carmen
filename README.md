## Login

Same email addresses than in Speedbots, with `password` as password.

## Goal

The goal is to catch a thief. To do so, you have to travel around the world virtually,
and ask questions to numerous people in different countries, towns and buildings.

When you learn something about the thief, you record this information, and that will
narrow the suspects list, down to one eventually. Then you can issue a warrant.

## WIP

This is a Work In Progress!

Many bugs are known, many features lack, and there are a ton of dialogs that are still to be written :)
